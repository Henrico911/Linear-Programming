# Linera-Programming
Real World Examples "solved"
# Simple Linear Programming Repository

This repository provides simple examples of solving linear programming problems using Python libraries such as NumPy, PuLP, SciPy, and Matplotlib. 
Linear programming is a mathematical optimization technique that finds the best outcome in a mathematical model with linear relationships.

## Jupyter Notebooks

Interactive Jupyter Notebooks are included for each example, allowing you to explore and run the code step by step. Launch the notebooks locally using the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Installation

To run the examples, make sure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pulp scipy matplotlib jupyter
```

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/linear-programming.git
cd linear-programming
```
